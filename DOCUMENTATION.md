DOCUMENTATION:

Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
```python

import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
```
These lines import the required libraries for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks. 

Step 2: Download NLTK Resources
```python

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```
This code downloads the necessary resources from the NLTK library, including tokenizers, stopwords, and WordNet, which is a lexical database for English language.

Step 3: Define Preprocessing Function
```python

def preprocess(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stopwords.words('english')]
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]
    return ' '.join(tokens)
```
This function preprocesses the text by tokenizing it into words, converting them to lowercase, removing stopwords (common words like "is", "the", "for"), and lemmatizing them (converting words to their base or dictionary form).

Step 4: Define Example Documents
```python

document1 = "Python is a programming language."
document2 = "Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language for general-purpose programming."
```
These lines define two example documents as strings.

Step 5: Preprocess Documents
```python
processed_doc1 = preprocess(document1)
processed_doc2 = preprocess(document2)
```
These lines preprocess the example documents using the `preprocess` function defined earlier.

Step 6: Vectorization
```python

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([processed_doc1, processed_doc2])
```
This code vectorizes the preprocessed documents using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which converts text documents into numerical vectors.

Step 7: Compute Cosine Similarity
```python

cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0], tfidf_matrix[1])
```
This line calculates the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of the two documents. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and indicates the similarity between the documents.

Step 8: Set Similarity Threshold
```python

threshold = 0.8
```
This line sets a threshold value for determining whether the similarity score indicates plagiarism.

Step 9: Check for Plagiarism
```python

if cosine_sim[0][0] > threshold:
    print("Plagiarism detected!")
else:
    print("No plagiarism detected.")
```
This code checks if the cosine similarity score between the two documents exceeds the threshold. If the similarity score is above the threshold, plagiarism is detected; otherwise, no plagiarism is detected.
By following these steps, you can preprocess text data, vectorize it, compute cosine similarity, and detect plagiarism in text documents.
